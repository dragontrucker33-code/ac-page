          The three tenets
The Creed mainly emphasized three simple moral tenets that focused on ensuring a successful mission, mastery of emotions, and the safety of the Brotherhood.[6][7]

Stay your blade from the flesh of an innocent
"There is freedom, and there is the life of innocents. Both must be balanced on the scale."
―Bayek to Gamilat, 38 BCE.[src]-[m]
The goal of the Assassins was to ensure peace in all things. The Assassins believed that political assassinations and the death of the corrupt would bring peace and a true sense of security to the common people. Slaying innocents and civilian bystanders who did not need to die could spread strife and discord, in addition to ruining the name of the Assassin Order itself.[7] It also prevented them from achieving their higher purpose as a precise killer instead of an indiscriminate butcher. This tenet was implemented by Bayek after the Nabatean rebels' leader Gamilat had used the slaughter of innocents as martyrs to recruit more people from the Sinai to the cause.[2]

Hide in plain sight
"Let the people mask you such that you become one with the crowd."
―Al Mualim to Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, 1191.[src]-[m]

Be unseen. The Assassins' aim was to get close to their target stealthily and escape just as quickly. In more ancient times, Assassins aimed to perform ostentatious, public assassinations. The greatest illusion from such an assassination was that the Assassin seemingly materialized from nowhere, killed a corrupt public figure, and vanished into the depths of the crowd or environment. If an Assassin was spotted while stalking their target, the supernatural effect would be diluted, and it became more difficult for the Assassin to reach their target.[7]

Never compromise the Brotherhood
"Its meaning should be obvious. Your actions must never bring harm upon us—direct or indirect!"
―Al Mualim chastising Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, 1191.[src]-[m]
The actions of one must never bring harm to all. If an Assassin failed in their duty, and was captured or chased, they must never commit any action or say anything that could be tied back to the Brotherhood, or bring harm to any member of it.[7]



The three ironies
"Do we bend the rules in service to a greater good? And if we do, what does it say of us?"
―Altaïr's Codex, page 4.[src]-[m]
The three great ironies were observations that had been noted as early as the Roman Empire,[6] and described the contradictions between the Creed and the actions of the Assassins who followed it. They were:

The Assassins seek to promote peace, but commit murder.
The Assassins seek to open the minds of men, but require obedience to rules.
The Assassins seek to reveal the danger of blind faith, yet practice it themselves.
Though seemingly hypocritical, the ironies did not undermine the Assassins' cause. Rather, they demonstrated the way in which they embraced contradiction, "that one may be two things—opposite in every way—simultaneously."[8] Another core part of the Creed is the importance of knowledge, which allows one to learn and advance. This was reflected on by Altaïr when about to kill Jubair al Hakim after he ordered a book burning.[9]

The Maxim
"Our Creed does not command us to be free. It commands us to be wise."
―Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad on the Creed's meaning, 1191.[src]-[m]

"Nothing is true, everything is permitted" is the Creed's maxim and primary guideline.[7] A rudimentary version of the phrase was first used by members of Artabanus' group, a precursor to the Brotherhood, in the 5th century BCE.[10] Scribes of the Persian sect of the Order of the Ancients under Amorges, a former member of Artabanus' group, were also familiar with the phrase.[11]

Al Mualim taught Altaïr that the maxim commanded the Assassins not to be free, but to be wise. Altaïr later explained that for a person to abide by the maxim, they had to transcend the illusion which was the world, and to "recognize that [...] laws do not arise from divinity, but reason".[12]

During the Renaissance, the Italian and Spanish Assassins recited the maxim at every new Assassin's induction into the Order. The maxim would first be said in its original Arabic by the Master Assassin or Mentor performing the induction, and then repeated by all Assassins present, including the inductee.[13][14][15]

In 1512, Ezio Auditore spoke of the maxim at length with Sofia Sartor, who found it rather cynical. However, he told her that the maxim was not a doctrine to be followed, but merely an observation of the nature of the world, explaining thusly:

"To say that nothing is true, is to realize that the foundations of society are fragile, and that we must be the shepherds of our own civilization. To say that everything is permitted, is to understand that we are the architects of our actions, and that we must live with their consequences, whether glorious or tragic."[16]

In 1721, the pirate Edward Kenway discussed the maxim with Ah Tabai, the Mentor of the West Indies Assassins, prior to joining the Brotherhood. Edward pondered why the Assassins believed in anything at all if "nothing is true" and why they did not chase their every desire if "everything is permitted", before concluding that "This idea [was] only the beginning of wisdom, and not its final form."[17]

Arno reflecting on the Creed

Around 1794, French Assassin Arno Dorian ruminated that the maxim merely served as a guide and a warning, rather than as a principle meant for an individual to follow, having witnessed directly how ideals led to dangerous extremism, elaborating that:

"Ideals too easily give way to dogma. Dogma becomes fanaticism. Only we can decide whether the road we walk carries too high a toll. All that we do, all that we are, begins and ends with ourselves."[18]

        <p class="creed__para">Ezio Auditore da Firenze (1459 – 1524) was a Florentine nobleman during the Renaissance, and, unbeknownst to most historians and philosophers, a Master Assassin and the Mentor of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins, a title which he held from 1503 to 1513. He is also an ancestor of William and Desmond Miles, as well as Clay Kaczmarek and Noa Kim.[4]

A member of the House of Auditore, Ezio remained unaware of his Assassin heritage until the age of 17, when he witnessed the hanging of his father Giovanni and two brothers, Federico and Petruccio. Forced to flee his birthplace with his remaining family members—his mother Maria and sister Claudia—Ezio took refuge with his uncle Mario in the Tuscan town of Monteriggioni, at the Villa Auditore. After learning of his heritage from Mario, Ezio began his Assassin training and set about on his quest for vengeance against the Italian Templars and their Grand Master Rodrigo Borgia, who had ordered the execution of his kin.

During his travels, Ezio managed to not only unite the pages of the Codex, written by the Levantine Assassins' Mentor Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, but also to save the cities of Florence, Venice, and Rome from Templar rule. He ensured Christoffa Corombo's future travels to the Americas, liberated Rome from Borgia rule, prevented Ercole Massimo's Cult of Hermes from rising to power, and helped spread the Renaissance and Assassin ideals of independence and free will throughout Italy.

In the years that followed, Ezio began a quest to rediscover the Assassins' lost history. Travelling to the aged fortress of Masyaf in order to learn more of the Assassins before him, he discovered it overrun with Templars and made his way to the city of Constantinople to uncover the location of the Masyaf Keys which, as he discovered, would unlock the fortress's fabled hidden library when brought together.

A decade later, Ezio had retired and resided in a Tuscan villa with his wife Sofia Sartor and his two children, Flavia and Marcello. Sometime after helping teach the Chinese Assassin Shao Jun the ways of the Order, Ezio died of a heart attack at the age of 65, during a visit to Florence with his wife and daughter.</p>
